# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using Random Forest

This repository contains the implementation of a predictive model for assessing the risk of heart attacks using the Random Forest Classifier. The model utilizes a comprehensive dataset of medical parameters to forecast the likelihood of heart attack occurrences with high accuracy and precision.

## Project Overview

In response to the high incidence and mortality rates associated with heart diseases, particularly acute coronary syndromes (ACS), this project leverages machine learning to improve diagnostic accuracy and preventive care. The Random Forest Classifier, known for its robust performance in handling complex and large datasets, is employed to predict heart attack risk based on various health indicators.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of 98.1% and precision of 98.17% in predicting heart attack risks.
- **Complex Data Handling**: Utilizes a dataset encompassing diverse health parameters such as blood pressure, sugar levels, and heart rate.
- **Feature Selection**: Implements feature selection techniques to enhance model performance and accuracy.
- **Model Tuning**: Focuses on refining the Random Forest model to adapt to varying data characteristics and improve predictive outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset includes a range of categorical and numerical data related to patient medical factors and diagnostic outcomes intended to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. It features parameters like age, gender, heart rate, blood pressure, and more.
